# 5. Mint from your contract

After instantiating your contract in Step 4, it's now possible to mint NFTs from the contract. If you have not already done so, make sure to replace `minter` in `config.json` with the address of your sale contract from the previous step.

Mint an NFT with:

```
yarn run mint --to [address]
```

Simply repeat the above for every address you want to mint an NFT for. The next sequential token ID will be used for each mint call.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This is how you can airdrop NFTs before public minting starts.
{% endhint %}
