# 1. Setup a basic project

## Initialize a new project

Setting up your project for minting is done via a set of command-line tools. Start by cloning a sample repository, and replace it with your project contents.

```
git clone https://github.com/public-awesome/stargaze-nft
cd stargaze-nft
yarn install
```

## Create a testnet account

In order to deploy a smart contract on Stargaze, you'll need an account with some STARS in it. For this tutorial, we will be instantiating our smart contract on the Stargaze testnet, Nebula.&#x20;

```
yarn run account
```

## Fund account from testnet faucet

In order to instantiate the contract and launch your project, you'l need some testnet tokens.&#x20;

```
yarn run fund --to [address]
```
